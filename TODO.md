Things I would improve:

1. Better error handling, adding <ErrorBoundary>
2. Better loading states, usage of <Suspense> and <Await> from React Router
3. Types and better type checks in general, didn't have time to properly type the response, I would usually also use a library like `zod` to verify anything 3rd party related.
4. Usage of things like `rtk-query`, `SWR` or `@tanstack-query`.
5. Optimizations (redundant for such a small test app, but I still didn't highlight any of my skills here)
6. Unit tests (highly important part)
